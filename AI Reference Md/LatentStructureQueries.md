We introduce Michelangelo: a minimal, synthetic, and unleaked long-context reasoning evaluation for
large language models which is also easy to automatically score. This evaluation is derived via a novel,
unifying framework for evaluations over arbitrarily long contexts which measure the model’s ability
to do more than retrieve a single piece of information from its context. The central idea of the Latent
Structure Queries framework (LSQ) is to construct tasks which require a model to “chisel away” the
irrelevant information in the context, revealing a latent structure in the context. To verify a model’s
understanding of this latent structure, we query the model for details of the structure. Using LSQ, we
produce three diagnostic long-context evaluations across code and natural-language domains intended
to provide a stronger signal of long-context language model capabilities. We perform evaluations on
several state-of-the-art models and demonstrate both that a) the proposed evaluations are high-signal
and b) that there is significant room for improvement in synthesizing long-context information.

1. Introduction
ThefamousRenaissance sculptorMichelangelowasonceasked how hewas abletobuildsuchbeautiful

my work. It is already there, I just have to chisel away the superfluous material.” In this work, we
draw a direct analogy between long-context language model understanding and the essence of the
sculptor’s task – an extremely large context can be viewed as a block of marble with many irrelevant
pieces of information, which the model must chisel away to reveal an understanding of the structure
within. We introduce Michelangelo, an automatic diagnostic long-context understanding evaluation
which is directly based on this principle, and develop the Latent Structure Queries (LSQ) framework
for generating such evaluations. LSQ allows us to develop considerably more complex evaluations
as compared to the popular needle in the haystack methodology (Kamradt, 2023). By requiring the
model to extract information from structures rather than values from keys (sculptures from marble

rather than needles from haystacks), we can more deeply test language model context understanding
beyond retrieval.
Large language models with extremely long context lengths from 128K tokens to surpassing 1M
tokens (Anthropic, 2023; Google et al., 2024; OpenAI, 2023) have recently become quite prominent
in the literature. However, the problem of developing reliable tests to measure the extent to which
these models are able to utilise the information in their context remains open.
The majority of attention in long-context evaluation has been focused on retrieval tasks, as
popularized by the single-needle-in-a-haystack retrieval task (Kamradt, 2023), with several follow-up
works additionally examining the retrieval of multiple needles (Google et al., 2024; Hsieh et al.,
2024; Li et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2024). Several more realistic long-context question-answering
evaluations have also been developed (Bohnet et al., 2024b; Kočisk`y et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2024),
and these tend to essentially reduce to solving a retrieval task in a more realistic setting.
More recently, several authors have highlighted the need for tests of long-context capability which
go beyond retrieval (Goldman et al., 2024; Karpinska et al., 2024; Levy et al., 2024). These results
point out that the ability of a model to retrieve one or more facts does not necessarily imply that a
model is able to synthesize information from the full context. Existing benchmarks which attempt to
measure a model’s capacity for reasoning over a long context (Arora et al., 2023; Li et al., 2024) may
have a few suboptimal properties. Some examples include:
• relatively small context lengths;
• high artificiality with no natural language or code setting;
• the requirement of significant amounts of human labor to extend to longer context lengths;
• a construction that clearly avoids scenarios where the tasks require the usage of the full context,
either because the information required to answer questions may be present in pretraining data
or because it is possible to “short-circuit” the context length and answer the question with more
local information.
Other approaches have focused on measuring a model’s capability for performing many-shot learning
2

Michelangelo: Long Context Evaluations Beyond Haystacks via Latent Structure Queries
(Agarwal et al., 2024; Bohnet et al., 2024a) and summarization (Chang et al., 2024; Kim et al.,
2024), neither of which necessarily require or measure a model’s capacity to reason over the context.
Additionally, many existing long-context evaluation benchmarks construct their evaluation by utilizing
pre-existing (and likely leaked-in-training-data) evaluations, making it difficult to ascertain the extent
to which performance on these benchmarks may be due to leaked information (Agarwal et al., 2024;
Bai et al., 2023; Bohnet et al., 2024a; Hsieh et al., 2024; Lee et al., 2024; Li et al., 2024; Zhang
et al., 2024). In this work, we focus on developing Michelangelo, a minimal, synthetic, and un-leaked
long-context reasoning evaluation which is also extremely easy to automatically score.
Minimality: Michelangelo constitutes a minimal set of the simplest canonical tasks which require
understanding of the context beyond retrieval, and yet are still challenging for present-day models to
solve. Minimal benchmarks, in both size and complexity, which capture a wide range of behavior are
desirable for many reasons: they are easy to interpret, easy to use for tracking progress, and inform
the simplest cases where a model is likely to fail.
Canonical Primitives:Michelangelo constitutes three intuitive and simple long-context synthesis
taskprimitiveswhichrequirethemodeltosynthesizemultiplepiecesofinformationstrewnthroughout
the context in order to produce an answer, and which measure different aspects of a model’s synthesis
capabilities to provide a more holistic understanding of long-context model behavior. Each of the
evaluations we present is positioned in a natural language or code-based setting, and is less synthetic
compared to existing benchmarks. We observe that it is already challenging to synthesize two pieces
of information across a context. In particular, Michelangelo measures the ability of a model to
• reproduce a given unique portion of the context while understanding ordering;
• understand a sequence of modifications to a list (which captures a very wide range of preexisting
tasks);
• determine whether the answer to a query is contained within the context.
Arbitrary Context Length:Michelangelo tasks are arbitrarily extendable in context length, while
maintaining a fixed complexity (as measured by the amount of relevant information in the context
that must be synthesized). This desiderata is fulfilled by the synthetic nature of the evaluation, and
by the approach we take to ensure that both the relevant information and the irrelevant information
are synthetically generated, (generally) share similar distributions, and do not result in logical
contradictions or short-circuits.
Leakage Prevention:Since it is possible to automatically re-generate Michelangelo task instances,
it is easy to avoid future leakage issues. The methodology we use to ensure the evaluations are both
automatically extendable to arbitrary context lengths and based on natural language does not rely
on utilizing existing evaluation sets or internet data (which are most likely leaked in training data),
and thus constitutes an un-leaked automatic, synthetic, and somewhat more realistic long-context
reasoning evaluation.
For an example of frontier model performance on one of the Michelangelo tasks, see Figure 1.
We demonstrate that this MRCR task may reveal interesting connections between existing models
in Figure 2. Notably, MRCR is evaluated with a simple metric and uses a fixed prompt across many
model families with no degradation in signal.
Our contributions are as follows:
• We present Michelangelo, a minimal benchmark for long-context reasoning and synthesis
primitives that measures foundation model performance across arbitrarily large context lengths.

• We design the Latent Structure Queries framework for long-context reasoning evaluations,
which encompasses and generalizes existing work on long-context evaluation. Michelangelo
consists of three simple instances of Latent Structure Queries which are measurably diverse
across the capability being measured and the data distribution it is instantiated upon.
• We analyze evaluations up to 1M context on several leading models with significantly higher
resolution over the context length, and analyze model performance. We demonstrate that GPT
and Claude models have non-trivial performance up to 128K context, while Gemini models
have non-trivial generalization capabilities all the way to 1M context. However, the difficulty of
the reasoning tasks induces an initial sharp drop off in performance for all frontier models we
evaluated, indicating that while significant progress has been made on generalizing reasoning
behavior up to 1M context, multiple simple long context reasoning primitives remain unsolved.
2. Michelangelo Evaluation Tasks
In this section, we present descriptions of the specific evaluations comprising Michelangelo and defer
discussion of the overarching framework used to produce these evaluations to Section 3.
2.1. Latent List
We consider a short Python list, and present a sequence of Python operations which modify that list
(append, insert, pop, remove, sort, reverse). Given this sequence of operations, the model is
required to output a view of the resulting latent list. This view can be toprint a full slice of the
list, asum, min, ormax of a slice of the list, or the length of the list. It is important to note that
the size of the resulting list is not dependent on the total context length of the instance – instead,
it is dependent on the number of relevant operations, the size of which indexes the task instance’s
complexity. To fill the context, we uniformly adopt three strategies which do not affect the list’s latent
state: 1) we insertprint(“Do nothing.”) statements, 2) we insert even numbers ofreverse
operations, 3) we insert blocks of operations which all cancel themselves out, locally. We consider
three complexity levels:1 relevant operation,5 relevant operations, and20 relevant operations,
also represented uniformly in the task set (note we do not count the first operation of defining the
4

Michelangelo: Long Context Evaluations Beyond Haystacks via Latent Structure Queries
initial list in this metric). The operations use numbers uniformly drawn between[−4000,4000]. The
relevant operations are spread uniformly throughout the input context.
We score model performance with an approximate accuracy metric, which requires exact string
match onprintview operations, and which reports an approximate error normalized to be within
[0,1]for numerical outputs (the rest of the view operations).
We use the following approximate metric to score the Latent List task. We use an approximate
metric to make the task easier for existing models, and we observe a wider dynamic range of signal
when using the approximate version of the task. The following code describes the exact method for
computing this score:
1 def latent_list_metric(
2 model_answer: str,
3 true_target: str,
4 view_op: str,
5 ) -> float:
6 """Computes approximate match for Latent List ."""
7 exact_score = float(int(str(model_answer) == true_target))
8
9 if view_op != 'print':
10 # Since the metric is fuzzy, model_answer is a number.
11 # Compute a normalized absolute error.
12 if not isinstance(model_answer, int):
13 err = 1.0
14 else:
15 try:
16 # Bounded in [0, 1]. Large incorrect answer should have high err.
17 norm = np.abs(float(true_target))
18 err = min(
19 1.0,
20 np.abs(float(true_target) - model_answer) / (1e-10 + norm),
21 )
22 except TypeError:
23 err = 1.0
24 return 1.0 - err
25
26 return exact_score
Since we have a very natural stratification of task instances into a notion of complexity (the
number of list operations that actually impact the answer to the view operation query), we can further
analyze performance on this evaluation as sliced by task complexity.

2.2. Multi-Round Co-reference Resolution (MRCR)
In the Multi-Round Co-reference Resolution (MRCR) task (previously introduced and described in
Google et al. (2024)), the model sees a long conversation between a user and a model, in which
the user requests writing (e.g. poems, riddles, essays) on different topics proceeded by the model
responses. To produce these model responses, we prompted the PaLM 2 model (Anil et al., 2023)
for many outputs corresponding to each request and topic. In each conversation, user requests
containing topics and writing formats distinct from the rest of the conversation are randomly placed
in the context. Given the conversation as context, the model must reproduce the output from the
conversation (the needle) resulting from one of the requests (the key). Either the formats, the
topics, or both, overlap in order to create a key that is adversarially similar to the query key. For
instance, the request “Reproduce the poem about penguins.” requires the model to distinguish
the poem about penguins from the poem about flamingos, and “Reproduce thefirst poem about
penguins.” requires the model to reason about ordering. We score MRCR via a string-similarity
measure between the model output and the correct response. Given a model output, we post-process
the output by checking whether the special output string has been produced. If it has been produced,
we take the text after the special output string and compute a string-similarity measure between the
6

Michelangelo: Long Context Evaluations Beyond Haystacks via Latent Structure Queries
model output and the correct response – specifically, the SequenceMatcher ratio as implemented in
https://docs.python.org/3/library/difflib.html. This value is between0 and 1.

...

Model: [Enter stage right.] Narrator: Long, long ago...
View Operation
User: Add the string “AKJSs89sal” to the 2𝑛𝑑 poem about penguins.
2.3. IDK
In the IDK task, a model is presented with a large amount of text and asked a question which does not
have an objective answer given the large pretraining corpus. For example, there may be an invented
story about a woman and her dog, where the dog’s name and age are detailed, but not its color.
Then the view operation would be to simply ask: “What is the color of the woman’s dog?”. For each
instance of this task, four multiple choice answers are presented, one of which is always “(D) I don’t
know”. Each of the other answer choices presented is a relatively plausible response. We score based
on whether or not the model output has the correct answer. If the model does not output any of the
multiple choice options, but instead indicates via text that the model cannot answer the question
because the information required is not present in the context, we also mark that as correct if the
7

Michelangelo: Long Context Evaluations Beyond Haystacks via Latent Structure Queries
correct answer is “I don’t know.” Since this metric is just accuracy, it is already between0 and 1. We
set 70% of the task instances in the evaluation to correspond to the true answer being “I don’t know”,
and 30% of the instances to correspond to the case where the answer is findable in the context and
constitutes a simple retrieval task.
For this evaluation, the irrelevant filler text corresponds to a random string of letters from the
English alphabet. Since for cases where the answer is IDK, we say there is “no relevant information”
and the task complexity is0. For the instances which correspond to retrieval tasks, the task complexity
is 1.

3. Latent Structure Queries : A Novel Long-Context Evaluation Framework
In this section, we present the simple Latent Structure Queries (LSQ) framework for creating the
synthetic long-context evaluations we defined in Section 2. Long-context evaluations should adhere
to the following principles:
• generically extendable to arbitrary context lengths;
• complexity indexed by the number of relevant pieces of information;
• context length difficulty should be decoupled from the complexity corresponding to the variant
of the task with no irrelevant information;
• coverage across natural language text and code (two basic domains);
• un-leaked contexts in the task instances;
• test understanding of implicit information conveyed in the context;
• the number of evaluations should be minimal and test orthogonal dimensions of long-context
synthesis capabilities.
The LSQ framework ensures all of these properties hold. We view the context presented to the
model as a stream of information which constitutes updates to a latent structure. One can imagine that
8

Michelangelo: Long Context Evaluations Beyond Haystacks via Latent Structure Queries
the full context length is like a block of marble with many irrelevant pieces of information. If a sculptor
chisels away the irrelevant pieces of information, they may reveal a statue inside – corresponding
to the latent structure revealed within the large context. Ultimately, we wish to query this latent
structure – the fact that the context has a complex relationship with this latent structure ensures that
the task associated with the data structure is “beyond retrieval”, with standard single-needle and
multiple-needle retrieval tasks like needle-in-a-haystack (Kamradt, 2023) corresponding to a data
structure with either one key and value or multiple independent keys and values, where one wishes
to query that key or set of keys. So, contextual understanding beyond retrieval can be measured by
understanding the extent to which the model has internalized the final version of this latent structure.
As a simple running example, one can imagine reading a book about a family which goes through
life - parents might divorce, children grow up and marry, elders pass away. Over the course of the
book, the latent structure corresponding to the family tree changes and is updated (and much of
the information in the book may not affect the family tree at all). Thus, the context of the full book
describes the latent structure of the family tree, and one simple approach to checking the model’s
understanding of the latent structure would be to query the model for a description of the full data
structure. However, this task may be a) too difficult and b) relatively intractable in natural language
settings where the structure itself is quite complex. Thus, we instead adopt an approach by which we
query slices of the structure. With many such queries of different slices (analogous to the parable of
the Elephant in the Dark (Wikipedia, 2024)), the model can demonstrate partial understanding of
the whole.
A significant advantage of this framework is the fact that we can control the complexity of the
task by predetermining the number of relevant updates to the latent structure. A relevant update
constitutes an update to the structure that changes the final output of a given query. By keeping the
number of relevant updates fixed, we can decompose the difficulty of the task into two orthogonal
components – the inherent complexity of the task without long distracting information, and the
difficulty of the task due to the context length. This decomposition is useful so that we can attempt
to isolate the effect of the only the context length on model performance (see the ablations which
decouple complexity and context length for Latent List in Section 5.5).
The number of irrelevant updates, on the other hand, controls the context length. As long as a task
has a method for generating irrelevant updates to the latent data structure, the task can be extended
to arbitrary context lengths. In particular, we can make use of large language models to generate
natural text which is completely irrelevant to the final task, while maintaining a closer resemblance to
the existing distribution of natural text, making a task more realistic while still retaining the desirable
synthetic properties.
This scheme of determining relevant updates and irrelevant fillera prioriand using generated
filler that is guaranteed to not impact the final answer for a given task instance allows us to ensure
that a) there is no leakage from pretraining data into the task (in contrast, the approach of simply
hot-swapping entity names in Zhang et al. (2024) of a novel to mitigate leakage may not sufficiently
control for this behavior, since it is still possible to use abundant circumstantial knowledge of the
novel in order to determine relevant sections of the text), and b) ensuring that in the creation of
our task, there are no short cuts the model can take without utilizing the full context – avoiding the
“short-circuit” problem from both ends.
Using this framework, we are able to develop relatively orthogonal tasks that measure different
components of long-context understanding beyond retrieval by varying both the implicit latent
structure corresponding to the task, as well as the task complexity as parameterized by the number of
relevant updates. Notably, we present one code-focused task and two natural-language-focused tasks
– our latent queries framework is broadly applicable regardless of the domain. We will proceed by
9

Michelangelo: Long Context Evaluations Beyond Haystacks via Latent Structure Queries
presenting three tasks utilizing this framework. Notably, each of these tasks is not intended to be
used for training prior to evaluation, for the reasons mentioned in Section 6. The code-related task is
not intended be run on a model which has access to a code editor - the goal is to test the implicit
reasoning behavior within the model circuits, as a proxy for even harder reasoning tasks which may
not be so easy to write code to solve.
3.1. Contextualizing Evaluations in the Latent Structure Queries Framework
3.1.1. Latent List
Latent List is a very direct implementation of the LSQ framework: the Python list is the latent
object, we query different components of the latent list, and it is updated with both operations that
meaningfully modify the list and operations which do not.
3.1.2. MRCR
The LSQ framework trivially encompasses the existing retrieval evaluations like Needle-in-a-Haystack
(Kamradt, 2023; Li et al., 2024) - they correspond exactly to retrieving a value given a key in a
dictionary. However, one major deficiency of many existing retrieval evaluations is how distinct the
needle is from the rest of the context. This property makes it significantly easier for large language
models to extract the relevant piece of information.
MRCR can be viewed as an extension of the Needle-in-a-Haystack task to the beyond-retrieval
setting which requires the model to use information about the ordering of multiple needles placed in
the haystack to answer the query. This setup has the advantage of creating highly similar needles to
be retrieved, and which requires the model to use information in two places in the context in order to
determine the correct answer.
This evaluation fits directly into the LSQ framework, where the latent data structure is a nested
dictionary indexed by topic and writing format. For each pair of topic and writing format, the latent
data structure stores a list of model outputs, in the order that they were presented in the context.
Then, the view operations are merely to output a model output value given two keys from the nested
dictionary, and in the case where the keys correspond to a list of model outputs of size greater than
one, the entry with the desired index. We also note that where in our presented version of the task
there are only two confounding outputs, it is easy to extend this evaluation to the setting where there
are multiple confounding outputs (and we may ask for the5𝑡ℎ poem about penguins, for instance,
rather than only the1𝑠𝑡 or 2𝑛𝑑). It is also easy to extend this task to the setting where we allow for
more deeply nested dictionaries, beyond depth2, by introducing more constraints on the output style.
For example, we could consider adding keys like emotion (“happy” or “sad”), style (“in the style of an
Italian mob boss”), and so on. We restrict our considerations to the minimal case where we observe
significant degradation as a function of context length, where we have a dictionary of depth2 and
where there is at most one additional doubly confounding (same topic and same format) instance in
the context.
3.1.3. IDK
IDK is another extremely simple and natural instance of the LSQ framework. In particular, it is the case
where the latent data structure does not contain an answer given the view operation’s parameters. A
simple realization of this case is a query to a dictionary with a key that does not have a corresponding
value – the correct answer is that the key is not present in the dictionary. Notably, to determine this
fact, the model must be able to rule out that any information present in the entire context contains
10

Michelangelo: Long Context Evaluations Beyond Haystacks via Latent Structure Queries
the answer to the query.
3.2. Context Stratification
When developing long-context models, it often makes sense to apply a staggered approach as a
function of context length – first ensure performance works up to 32K context, then 128K context,
and then finally 1M context. As it is more expensive to run longer context evaluations, this approach
allows the model developer to iterate more quickly.
Withthisdevelopmentprocessinmind, weprovidethreesubsetsforeachevaluation: Adistribution
of samples up to 32K context, a distribution of samples up to 128K context, and a distribution of
samples up to 1M context. All of these individual subsets measure cumulative performance, and can
be stacked together and normalized by bucket (e.g., we can consider only 32K subset, the union of
32K and 128K subsets, or the union of all three subsets 32K, 128K, and 1M, weighted equally) to
decrease variance. To normalize, we divide by the number of repetitions of each bucket in order
to keep a similar histogram profile of the context lengths. For instance, when considering all three
subsets (32K, 128K, and 1M), we divide the 32K bucket by 3 since it shows up three times, and the
128K bucket by 2 since it shows up twice.
3.3. Prompting Approach
For all tasks, we first present the model with a description of the task, followed by a few-shot approach
in which we introduce demonstrations of short-context examples of the task. The full prompts are
in Appendix A. The prompt for the MRCR task is additionally noteworthy. In MRCR, the model is
required to reproduce a chunk of text up to512 tokens, and we have found it helpful to require
the model to prefix a random string to the output. This prefix helps test that the model is following
instructions and helps post-process the longer output of the model, which should be only the content
output following the random string. This tweak to the prompt is particularly important for MRCR,
since we score the model output based on an approximate edit distance score, which is in contrast
with the majority of existing long-context evaluations (and which has the nice property of resulting
in a very smooth context-performance curve that degrades as a function of context).
3.3.1. Pre-training and Post-training Evaluation
While in this report we only describe results on post-trained models, we note that we have successfully
used the Latent List and MRCR tasks as pretraining evaluations as well. For pretraining evaluations,
the few-shot nature of the prompts is critical to ensuring a good signal. For post-training evaluations
on all models we tried, MRCR worked out of the box with no tweaks. On the other hand, Latent List
and IDK both required additional post-processing in order to ensure the signal was captured due to
variations in model output styles.
4. Experimental Results
We evaluate ten frontier models of varying sizes on our long beyond-retrieval evaluation tasks: Gemini
1.5 Flash (05-14 and 08-27) and Pro (05-14 and 08-27) (Google et al., 2024), GPT-4 Turbo (04-09)
and GPT-4o (OpenAI, 2023, 2024), Claude 3 Haiku, Sonnet, and Opus (Anthropic, 2024a), and
Claude 3.5 Sonnet (Anthropic, 2024b). In our experiments, we observe that the rank orderings differ
across each of our evaluations – further highlighting the fact that we are capturing a broad spectrum
of long-context reasoning behavior with a minimal set of evaluations.

Figure 3|Gemini models perform the best on MRCR at 128K context, and notably have a significantly
different slope profile compared to GPT and Claude.
For each task, we present plots which set average context length in tokens against the cumulative
average score for the task at 128K and 1M context. In all our plots, higher score is better and is
bounded between[0,1]. For 1M context, we only plot the Gemini 1.5 models, while the others are
all plotted up to 128K context length. For each plot, we select the best performing models from each
family to be plotted. Note that for the Latent List tasks, Claude-3 Haiku and Sonnet and Claude-3.5
Sonnet performance was very low due to model refusal rates. We exclude these models from the
plots.
4.1. Initial Degradation up to 128K
We now consider a closer look up to 128K context for each of the evaluations, and identify the winning
model families. See Figures 3, 4, and 5.
4.2. Gemini’s Non-Decreasing Performance from 128K to 1M
In this section, we demonstrate that on these evaluations, Gemini performance does not decrease
from 128K to 1M context. See Figures 6, 7, and 8.

5. Discussion
5.1. Measuring Different Aspects of Long Context Understanding
First, we establish that Michelangelo has subtasks which measure different components of long
context utilization. MRCR measures the model’s ability to understanding ordering in natural text, to
distinguish between similar drafts of writing, and to reproduce a specified piece of previous context
subject to adversarially difficult queries. Latent List measures the ability of a model to track a latent
data structure’s properties over the course of a stream of code instructions. IDK measures the model’s
ability to understand whether it knows what it doesn’t know based on the presented context. Each
of these long context synthesis primitives is significantly more difficult than both needle retrieval
and multi-needle retrieval tasks, and this result is reflected in the context-vs-average-cumulative-
performance curves.
Notably, the model families we evaluate each perform significantly differently on these core
primitives. Gemini models perform the best on MRCR, GPT models outperform others on Latent List,
and Claude-3.5 Sonnet performs the best on IDK (while intriguingly, GPT performs the worst on
IDK!).
Figure 9 records the cross-correlations between these evaluations, measured across ten different
models and calculated using Spearman rank correlation. Thus we also have quantitative evidence
that Michelangelo evaluations measure diverse aspects of long context understanding.
Based on these results, we can conclude that each evaluation measures something rather different
in terms of long context understanding, and there are possibly even trade-offs in performance to be
made across these three evaluations. Of the frontier models we have measured, none is the clear
winner on all three Michelangelo tasks.

models. We observe that Latent List and IDK are anti-correlated, while MRCR and Latent List have
some rank correlation, it is fairly far from1. These rank correlations were computed only over the
ten models in this report.
5.2. Degradation before 32K Context
As we can observe from the context versus performance plots (Figures 3, 4, and 5), the models often
degrade in score quite early in the context (at 32K), allowing us to more efficiently detect degradation
in long-context performance when using Michelangelo . This property is in contrast with existing
long evaluation benchmarks like Hsieh et al. (2024), where one must look as far as 128K context to
see any degradation in performance.
In particular, we see a very common trend across all of the Michelangelo evaluations: There is
one initial sharp super-linear drop in performance in short-context (note that the task complexity
is kept fixed across the context, so this drop is entirely due to the model’s long-context processing
capabilities), after which performance often either flattens out or continues to degrade at a roughly
linear rate. In the cases where performance flattens out, this behavior often lasts until very large
context lengths. We can interpret this behavior as suggesting that the model has sub-capabilities
which are sufficiently good to achieve a certain level of performance on a given task, and that those
sub-capabilities length-generalize all the way to very large context lengths.
5.3. Cross-Over Behaviors with Increasing Context Length
We note that different models’ performance drops at different rates as a function of context length,
leading to scenarios where model performance on a given evaluation crosses over – at long enough
context lengths, one model which was previously worse on a task may become better than another
model which was previously better. We observe this phenomenon in Figure 6, 7, 8, and 13. Generally,
Gemini models often outstrip the performance of GPT and Claude models on each of the various tasks
at long enough context lengths, though not always. It is particularly interesting to note that Gemini
1.5 Flash outperforms GPT and Claude models on MRCR and IDK at long enough context lengths,
and that advantage is retained up to 1M tokens of context.
This behavior highlights a potential tradeoff between short-context performance and long-context
performancethatthesemodelsmaymake. OnMRCR,wenotethatGPTandClaudemodelsoutperform
Gemini models on context smaller than 8K, but have a correspondingly higher rate of decay in length
generalization performance, indicating that short and long context performance may be difficult to
balance.
16

Michelangelo: Long Context Evaluations Beyond Haystacks via Latent Structure Queries
5.4. Parallel Model Family Curves on MRCR
In Figure 2, we pointed out that various model families have parallel curves on MRCR, an intriguing
phenomenon. We highlight this property as both evidence for the fact that the evaluation bears high
signal, as well as a pointer to paths for future investigation. Since the curves between certain model
pairs so closely parallel each other, we suspect that there were uniquely similar aspects of the model
training process in these models (even though there may be an absolute disparity in performance).
Future work should investigate evaluations which reveal implicit information about model training.
We also note that we found MRCR to be a particularly robust measure of performance. MRCR
behavior across models required no changes to the prompt in order to ensure the model gave a
verifiable output with low variance.
5.5. Stratifying Latent List by Complexity
In this section we validate the claim that higher complexity tasks are more difficult as measured by
score (Figures 10, 11, 12). We also note that the highest complexity task has a significantly steeper
slope as a function of context length, especially for the highest performing model, GPT-4o, suggesting
that as the task complexity increases, the more rapid the performance fall-off as a function of context
length. Notably, on the highest task complexity, performance of GPT-4o is on par with GPT-4T and
the Gemini 1.5 models (Figure 12).

5.6. Slicing IDK Performance When the Answer is “I Don’t Know”
In Figure 13 we similarly observe a steeper fall-off curve in performance when we restrict IDK to
task instances where the answer is only “I don’t know”. This task is harder because it requires the
model to assess the full context for information which may not be present, rather than identify a
single location where an answer may be located. Notably, Gemini 1.5 Pro performs slightly better
than Claude 3.5 Sonnet on long-enough contexts on this subtask.

5.7. An Interesting Failure Mode: GPT Models Hallucinate Puzzles in IDK
We previously noted that the GPT-4 family performs significantly worse than the other model families
on IDK in Figure 13 – this is due to an interesting quirk in that model family’s behavior. When
presented with a string of random letters, both GPT-4 models sometimes assume that there is a hidden
riddle in the text, and attempt to “solve" the riddle by hallucinating the presence of one of the answer
choices. This leads to a significantly worse performance. We provide examples of this behavior in
Figure 14.
Note that the OpenAI API does not allow inputs with simpler context (like for instance, “X X
X··· ”), presumably due to repetition attack schemes (Nasr et al., 2023) which cause the model to
reproduce its training data.

6. Related Work
6.1. Broader Work on Long Context Evaluation
For the purposes of this paper, we consider “long-context” to mean at least 32K context examples
(ideally at least 128K context). There have been many recent long-context evaluation benchmarks,
which tend to focus on retrieval (Bohnet et al., 2024b; Google et al., 2024; Hsieh et al., 2024; Kamradt,
2023; Kočisk`y et al., 2018; Li et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2024) and in-context many-shot learning
(Agarwal et al., 2024; Bohnet et al., 2024a) rather than reasoning. There is also existing work on
long-context summarization (Chang et al., 2024; Kim et al., 2024). In this paper we focus exclusively
on evaluations for reasoning over a long-context. In particular, we assume that there is a sparse
set of relevant information embedded in the context, not all of which is immediately identifiable
independent of other portions of the context. The relevant information must be synthesized rather
than merely retrieved.
Another popular approach for claiming long-context capability is to create plots of context length
vs. average perplexity on a designated set of long documents (Anthropic, 2023; Google et al., 2024).
It is worth noting that the decreasing perplexity for a fixed model (the difference in magnitude
between the average perplexities at the longest context and the shortest context) is anti-correlated
with the difference in error between the longest context and the shortest context on the long reasoning
evaluations we introduce in this report. Note that the anti-correlation is immediate from the fact
that the perplexity plots are approximately monotone decreasing as a function of context length,
while the error plots for the evaluations we present are approximately monotone increasing as a
function of context lengths (accuracy is approximately monotone decreasing). Thus, examining the
context-vs-perplexity plot on a single model may not be a proxy for understanding model performance
as measured by accuracy on complex long reasoning tasks, though it is possible that it can be a proxy
for capabilities like many-shot in-context learning for translation tasks (see for instance some of the
examples in Google et al. (2024)).
Another noteworthy point is that the majority of long-context evaluations use multiple-choice
formats (sometimes only with two possible responses) – this paradigm is considerably limiting. While
some other methods use ROUGE-style scores (especially in summarization) or human evaluations,
both of these approaches can be additionally problematic in both noisiness (see for instance the
discussions in Cohan and Goharian (2016) and Akter et al. (2022)) and cost.
6.2. Challenges with Developing Reliable and Minimal Long Reasoning Evaluations
There are a few pre-existing evaluations which study arbitrarily long reasoning tasks, with evaluations
sometimes going up to 1M context, including Hsieh et al. (2024); Kuratov et al. (2024); Lee et al.
(2024); Li et al. (2024); Zhang et al. (2024). These existing evaluations tend to suffer from at least
one of a few deficiencies:
• Short-circuiting: When an evaluation task does not account for information in either training
data or later in the context which the model can use to avoid requiring the full context to answer
a query, we say the model can “short-circuit” the long-context and perform well on the task
while not actually representing a utilization of the context. As one example, the tasks in Kuratov
et al. (2024) may all suffer from this problem, both because the evaluation from which the
expanded tasks are derived is heavily leaked and because the tasks themselves are significantly
flawed (Kaushik and Lipton, 2018). Many similarly constructed evaluations (perhaps using
different base evaluations) have the same issues.
• Secret retrieval tasks:Some recently popular evaluation benchmarks (for instance, Hsieh
21

Michelangelo: Long Context Evaluations Beyond Haystacks via Latent Structure Queries
et al. (2024); Li et al. (2024)) describe a subset of their tasks as testing long-context reasoning
capabilities. However, due to their construction, they often do not represent a task which
requires anything more than single-needle or multi-needle retrieval. As one example of such a
task, we consider the Variable Tracing (VT) task from RULER (Hsieh et al., 2024). On the surface
level, the task contains a context filled with many variable assignments (e.g.𝑋 = 3; 𝑌 = 𝑋; 𝑍 = 𝑌
and so on, interspersed with distractor context). The model is then required to enumerate
all variables which have the value3. However, in the default RULER implementation of this
task, every variable which has been introduced in the context actually indeed has the value3 -
there are no spurious variables present. Thus this setting of the task is ultimately reduced to
a multi-needle retrieval task, where the needles correspond to the mentioned variable names,
and is why we see exceedingly high performance on this task from many models.
• Out-of-distribution distractor context:Many existing tasks proceed by inserting dramatically
out-of-distribution context in order to form the irrelevant information component of the evalua-
tion, such as Paul Graham essays or repeated phrases (Hsieh et al., 2024; Kamradt, 2023; Li
et al., 2024). This setup makes the problem significantly easier, since it implicitly brings any
long reasoning task closer to a retrieval task – if the relevant information isa prioriidentifiable
without understanding anything about the interrelated nature of the relevant information, then
the task becomes effectively a multi-needle retrieval task.
• Training on toy synthetic tasks:Some evaluation methods (often older evaluation sets from
the pre-modern LLM era, like the Long Range Arena (LRA) (Tay et al., 2020)) require the model
to train on the task to see good performance on the task. These evaluations test the ability of a
given architecture tolearn a specific task, which while potentially interesting, is not the key
point of interest in our setting, as we hope that via next-token prediction we will learn far more
interesting long reasoning circuits that apply more generally over language and multimodal
elements.
See Appendix D for a more detailed breakdown of these issues and how they apply to additional
existing proposed long reasoning evaluations.
Another relevant long-reasoning evaluation is the SPIDER task in the LOFT benchmark (Lee et al.
(2024)), which tests multi-hop reasoning for SQL queries. SPIDER is quite focused on a particular
application (SQL), and we include some orthogonal tests of long reasoning in our benchmark.
Michelangelo avoids the above pitfalls by ensuring that the irrelevant information in the context
is indeed completely unrelated to the information required to answer the query, and by ensuring that
the relevant information in the query is completely unique and/or there is no information present in
training data which would be helpful for answering the query, since it is too generic. For most of the
tasks, we also ensure that the irrelevant information is not significantly out-of-distribution compared
to the relevant information, thus creating a more realistic setting where the relevant information is
not clearly different from surrounding context.
7. Conclusion
We introduced the Michelangelo evaluations, a suite of long-context synthesis and reasoning eval-
uations built using the Latent Structure Queries framework for developing long-context reasoning
evaluations which can be arbitrarily extended in length and set to arbitrary complexity levels while
avoiding leaked context from pre-existing evaluations. We propose three minimal simple tasks in this
framework – Latent List, MRCR, and IDK – which highlight simple cases of tasks beyond retrieval
which current frontier long-context models do not solve, even up to 32K context. We analyze ten
frontier models with long-context capabilities on these tasks up to 128K context, and we further run
22

Michelangelo: Long Context Evaluations Beyond Haystacks via Latent Structure Queries
these evaluations on the Gemini 1.5 family up to 1M context, and observe that though there is a
significant initial degradation in behavior on these evaluations, after a certain point, many (but not
all) frontier models experience a non-trivial flattening of the context-vs-performance curve, suggesting
that while some long-context capabilities are present in these models (e.g. the ability to retrieve),
there is still a significant gap in capability compared to the goal of reasoning over long contexts.
One important part of the contributions of this work is to validate the robustness and smoothness
of MRCR across multiple frontier models. MRCR benefits from using a very simple metric and is more
robust to prompting choices as compared to Needle-in-a-Haystack. In internal testing, we have also
discovered that this evaluation has high signal for smaller models as well as models which have not
been post-trained. Thus, we also make a recommendation – given that MRCR minimally tests a simple
primitive of beyond-retrieval understanding of long contexts while also capturing harder distractor
contexts for retrieval, MRCR and its natural extensions are a suitable default replacement for the
popular Needle-in-a-Haystack evaluation, in which the needle is often quite apparently different from
the rest of the text in a manner that stands out and which fails to capture nuance in measuring model
capabilities over long-contexts.

B. Appendix: Chance Rate Estimation
B.1. Estimating the Chance Rate for Latent List
Since Latent List is scored via an approximate metric, it is non-immediate to determine what a
reasonable estimate of a chance rate for this evaluation is. To estimate the chance rate, for each
view operation type and for each difficulty level, we assume the random model uniformly samples
from the space of all possible outputs and compute the average score. In particular, for thelen
operation, we suppose the random model uniformly outputs a length between0 and the number of
relevant operations (corresponding to difficulty level), and that the true length is similarly uniformly
distributed over this range. With no further assumptions about the random model, the chance rate
is 0.01%. Therefore, to provide a more realistic estimation of the chance rate, for theprint, sum,
max, minoperations, we assume the random model instead may restrict to considering the specific
numbers present in the relevant operations, though it may not necessarily know how to combine them
to compute the correct latent list. In particular, forprintand sum, we assume the random model
uniformly samples a subset of the numbers involved in the relevant operations, and also subsamples
from the initial list (the array[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]) to construct the random model’s guess for the
value of the latent list (randomly shuffled). Then, forprintand sum, the random model samples a
slice of that list to compare to the true slice, and also computes the sum over that slice to compare
to the true sum. Forminand max, we assume the random model uniformly picks a single entry of
the randomly selected latent list and compares to the true list. We then average over the complexity
levels (complexities1,5,20), which are uniformly present in the evaluation instances. Computing the

randommodelwhichuniformlyoutputsoneofthepiecesofwriting, ascomputedwiththeapproximate

chance rate in this manner yields a chance rate of12.2% on average over all complexity levels,16.9%
for complexity level1, 11.3% for complexity level5, and8.5% for complexity level20.
B.1.1. Estimating the Chance Rate for MRCR
Since this evaluation is scored via an approximate edit distance metric, it is non-immediate to
determine what a reasonable estimate of a chance rate for this evaluation is. One approach we can
take to determine an estimate of the chance rate is to assume that the model outputs one of the most
related options (however, this does not take into account the cases where the model may partially
reconstruct the correct output, where the model may refuse to reproduce any output, and where the
model outputs a less relevant output). The chance rate when computed assuming a model randomly
outputs any of the possible outputs in the conversation history is4%, and the histogram of chance
rates per example is plotted in Figure 15.
We can also consider computing the chance rate over instances where we assume a random model
would output one of the instances where at least one of either the topic or the format is matched. The
chance rate when computed this way is9%, which as expected is larger. The histogram of chance
rates per example is plotted in Figure 16.
B.2. Chance Rate for IDK
Since the query is a multiple choice question with four options, the chance rate is25%.

D. Appendix: Detailed Challenges with Developing Reliable and Minimal Long
Reasoning Evaluations
As mentioned in Section 6, there are a few pre-existing evaluations which study arbitrarily long
reasoning tasks, with evaluations sometimes going up to 1M context, including Hsieh et al. (2024);
Kuratovetal.(2024);Leeetal.(2024);Lietal.(2024);Zhangetal.(2024). Theseexistingevaluations
tend to suffer from at least one of a few deficiencies:
• Short-circuiting: When an evaluation task does not account for information in either training
data or later in the context which the model can use to avoid requiring the full context to answer
a query, we say the model can “short-circuit” the long-context and perform well on the task
while not actually representing a utilization of the context. As one example, the tasks in Kuratov
et al. (2024) may all suffer from this problem, both because the evaluation from which the
expanded tasks are derived is heavily leaked (as it is a famous evaluation from almost a decade
ago), and also because tasks themselves have built-in biases which remove the requirement that
the model must use the full input (Kaushik and Lipton, 2018). Some evaluations make efforts
to combat this behavior. As an example, Zhang et al. (2024) attempts to resolve this problem
for a modified long QA task by swapping the names of characters in a book with randomly
generated character name (“key entity replacement”). However, this mitigation does not control
for the vast amounts of memorized information from pretraining which can still be helpful for
localizing answers to questions about the book, independent of the character name - characters
are often defined by many other quite distinguishable properties. The QA task from Hsieh et al.
(2024) has a similar problem in that it utilizes existing likely leaked questions from SQuAD and
HotpotQA, augmented with filler context. Note that there are also similar issues with SQuAD
(Kaushik and Lipton, 2018). Finally, the authors of Li et al. (2024) also note a flaw of this
nature, as the needles are also derived from datasets curated from Wikipedia (and the datasets
themselves are also present online, and thus likely leaked) - as they note, it is challenging to
determine whether the models are simply utilizing internal knowledge here.
• Secret retrieval tasks:Some recently popular evaluation benchmarks (for instance, Hsieh et al.
(2024); Li et al. (2024)) describe a subset of their tasks as corresponding to testing long-context
reasoning capabilities. However, due to their construction, they often do not represent a task
which requires anything more than single-needle or multi-needle retrieval. As one example
of such a task, we consider the Variable Tracing (VT) task from RULER (Hsieh et al., 2024).
On the surface level, the task contains a context filled with many variable assignments (e.g.
𝑋 = 3; 𝑌 = 𝑋; 𝑍 = 𝑌 and so on, interspersed with distractor context). The model is then
required to enumerate all variables which have the value3. However, in the default RULER
implementation of this task, every variable which has been introduced in the context actually
indeed has the value3 - there are no spurious variables present. Thus this setting of the task
is ultimately reduced to a multi-needle retrieval task, where the needles correspond to the
mentioned variable names, and is why we see exceedingly high performance on this task from
many models. Related issues exist for the Common/Frequent Words Extraction (CWE/FWE)
tasks in RULER (Hsieh et al., 2024)) – if there are large disparities in the frequencies of the most
common words, the model need not solve the task by actually performing fine-grained counting.
Instead, it needs to simply generate the most likely continuous tokens (and repeats in the
context increase the probability of a word being selected as the next token). Thus, the problem
ultimately reduces to a task similar to multi-needle retrieval - which of the most common words
have not yet been output? The GitHub repository for RULER acknowledges that while the tasks
are configurable (and indeed, it is fairly easy to change the task parameters to be harder and
require reasoning beyond retrieval), the benchmark itself avoids doing so since most models
can attain a strong performance on the default task settings. The GitHub repository notes that
35

Michelangelo: Long Context Evaluations Beyond Haystacks via Latent Structure Queries
more difficult variants of the tasks were not stress-tested, leading to the fairly high-scores on
the RULER leaderboard. Ultimately, this trade-off results in the present form of RULER only
testing single and multi-needle retrieval capabilities. We also note that the harder variants of
VT/CWE/FWE all fit into the LSQ framework, but are significantly more artificial as compared
to the Michelangelo tasks. Finally, many tasks which may require complex reasoning reduce
to retrieval tasks if part of the prompt decomposes the problem into a sequence of retrieval
problems, like the recently proposed HashHop task (Magic, 2024). In HashHop, the model
is required to output a key following a sequence of𝑘 “hops” from key to value repeatedly in
a large dictionary of keys and values which occupy the same vocabulary set. Assuming the
model follows instructions or can follow few-shot prompting (possibly induced by training
on the task), given examples where the model chains the hops together, the task reduces to
computing the minimum over𝑘 single-needle retrieval tasks (which is simply a more stringent
metric than an average, but is not fundamentally different in what it measures compared to
single-needle evaluations, and is furthermore not different in value as well if a model has a
perfect single-needle retrieval performance). HashHop also fits into the LSQ framework and is
more artificial than the Michelangelo tasks.
• Out of distribution distractor context:Many existing tasks proceed by inserting dramatically
out-of-distribution context in order to form the irrelevant information component of the eval-
uation, such as Paul Graham essays or repeated phrases (Hsieh et al., 2024; Kamradt, 2023;
Li et al., 2024). This makes the problem significantly easier, since it implicitly brings any long
reasoning task closer to a retrieval task – if the relevant information isa prioriidentifiable
without understanding anything about the interrelated nature of the relevant information, then
the task becomes effectively a multi-needle retrieval task.
• Training on toy synthetic tasks:Some evaluation methods (often older evaluation sets from
the pre-modern LLM era, like the Long Range Arena (LRA) (Tay et al., 2020)) require the model
to train on the task to see good performance on the task. Results on the non-CoT version of
HashHop (Magic, 2024) were recently presented using this paradigm as well. We emphasize
that the goal of these evaluation sets is rather different from the goal of Michelangelo: we would
like to test for the ability of the model to learn useful reasoning circuits which operate over
long-context which are very general. When these train-test evaluation sets impose a requirement
to train on a highly idiosyncratic task, we are instead testing the ability of a given architecture
to learn a specific task, which while potentially interesting, is not the key point of interest in
our setting, as we hope that via next-token prediction we will learn far more interesting long
reasoning circuits that apply more generally over language and multimodal elements.
Synthetic evaluations do not have the above issues when constructed carefully, simply because
their artificial nature allows for significantly more control in design. However, artificiality is itself
undesirable. We would like to strike a middle ground between controllable (no short-circuiting,
arbitrary context length, arbitrary controlled complexity) highly synthetic and unrealistic evaluations,
and extremely realistic evaluations which are very difficult to control for. In particular, many issues
arise: if a new long evaluation attempts to modify an existing leaked evaluation to make it longer
context, then it suffers from the fact that the base evaluation is leaked. Often, inserted context
has leaked information, leading to uncontrolled information presence and possible short-circuiting
in-context. In completely realistic context this is also an issue since it gets proportionally more difficult
as a function of context length to verify which information is present as well as where the information
is present in the context. Realistic context evaluations are also not automatically extendable and
require significant human labor, which can be error-prone due to the difficulty of parsing information
in long-contexts for humans. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that for realistic tasks it is
significantly more difficult to control the amount of relevant information and thus the complexity of
36

Michelangelo: Long Context Evaluations Beyond Haystacks via Latent Structure Queries
the task. Ultimately, we would like a long-context evaluation to have both properties - it should be
highly controllable (in terms of task complexity and context length), guarantee that the contexts for
each task instance have no presence in pretraining data, and genuinely require the model to reason
across the whole context, while not being an extremely toy or synthetic task.
Evaluations which are overly synthetic can express this nature in a few different ways: 1) the
distractor context is highly synthetic and different from the relevant information (and is sometimes
easily found available online); 2) the language of the task is itself highly unnatural (for instance - toy
reasoning tasks based on alphabetic strings); 3) the task itself is highly contrived and it is unclear
how it might be relevant. The last issue is particularly hard to avoid.
